# Project-ShopAndSell-Android
In this app there are two options for the user either to sell their own item or to buy the items uploaded by other people.

**Shop and Sell - Android Project**

The app uses android studio , XML, Java and PHP for combining and building all of its features. For the  user interface we have used different layouts in the XML files. Java is used for building the business logic for the layout files.PHP is used to store the data on the server from the app and to get the data from the server into the app.
In the app there are two options for the user either to sell their own item or to buy the items uploaded by other people. To sell the person need to add his details and the item details and agree to the conditions. Once the item is uploaded it can viewed by others in the buy option.
To buy a product click on the buy option and select the item you are interested in buying.Select it see the price and buyer name and call the buyer to buy the product.
A new user can know about the app in the “About” option in the menu and for any problem with the app a person can mail us his/her query in the “Help” option in the menu.
